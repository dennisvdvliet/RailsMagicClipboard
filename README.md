Css2Sass
========

Sublime text plugin to convert CSS to SASS from paste.

Basically, the use case:

Map "super+v" to the "css\_to_sass" command in your user key bindings. From there, start pasting raw CSS into your .css.sass files and be amazed as pure sass goodness is pasted into your file.

This will only effect text pasted into .css.sass files.

If you are using RVM or another ruby version manager you have to set the path in the settings file for Css2Sass with your $PATH variable. You can view the contents of your $PATH variable by running echo $PATH on the command line.
