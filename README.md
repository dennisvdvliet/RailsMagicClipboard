Css2Sass
========

Sublime text plugin to convert CSS to SASS from paste.

Basically, the use case:

Map "super+v" to the "css\_to_sass" command in your user key bindings. From there, start pasting raw CSS into your .css.sass files and be amazed as pure sass goodness is pasted into your file.

This will only effect text pasted into .css.sass files.
